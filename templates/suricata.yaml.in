# Flow settings:
# By default, the reserved memory (memcap) for flows is 32MB. This is the limit
# for flow allocation inside the engine. You can change this value to allow
# more memory usage for flows.
# The hash-size determines the size of the hash used to identify flows inside
# the engine, and by default the value is 65536.
# At startup, the engine can preallocate a number of flows, to get better
# performance. The number of flows preallocated is 10000 by default.
# emergency-recovery is the percentage of flows that the engine needs to
# prune before clearing the emergency state. The emergency state is activated
# when the memcap limit is reached, allowing new flows to be created, but
# pruning them with the emergency timeouts (they are defined below).
# If the memcap is reached, the engine will try to prune flows
# with the default timeouts. If it doesn't find a flow to prune, it will set
# the emergency bit and it will try again with more aggressive timeouts.
# If that doesn't work, then it will try to kill the oldest flows using
# last time seen flows.
# The memcap can be specified in kb, mb, gb.  Just a number indicates it's
# in bytes.

# This option controls the use of VLAN ids in the flow (and defrag)

# setups where both sides of a flow are not tagged with the same VLAN
# tag, we can ignore the VLAN id's in the flow hashing.

# Specific timeouts for flows. Here you can specify the timeouts that the
# active flows will wait to transit from the current state to another, on each
# protocol. The value of "new" determines the seconds to wait after a handshake or
# stream startup before the engine frees the data of that flow it doesn't
# change the state to established (usually if we don't receive more packets
# of that flow). The value of "established" is the amount of
# seconds that the engine will wait to free the flow if that time elapses
# without receiving new packets or closing the connection. "closed" is the
# amount of time to wait after a flow is closed (usually zero). "bypassed"
# timeout controls locally bypassed flows. For these flows we don't do any other
# tracking. If no packets have been seen after this timeout, the flow is discarded.
#
# There's an emergency mode that will become active under attack circumstances,
# making the engine to check flow status faster. This configuration variables
# use the prefix "emergency-" and work similar as the normal ones.
# Some timeouts doesn't apply to all the protocols, like "closed", for udp and

## Performance tuning and profiling
##

# The detection engine builds internal groups of signatures. The engine
# allows us to specify the profile to use for them, to manage memory in an
# efficient way keeping good performance. For the profile keyword you
# can use the words "low", "medium", "high" or "custom". If you use custom,
# make sure to define the values in the "custom-values" section.
# Usually you would prefer medium/high/low.
#
# "sgh mpm-context", indicates how the staging should allot mpm contexts for
# the signature groups.  "single" indicates the use of a single context for
# all the signature group heads.  "full" indicates a mpm-context for each
# group head.  "auto" lets the engine decide the distribution of contexts
# based on the information the engine gathers on the patterns from each
# group head.
#
# The option inspection-recursion-limit is used to limit the recursive calls
# in the content inspection code.  For certain payload-sig combinations, we
# might end up taking too much time in the content inspection code.
# If the argument specified is 0, the engine uses an internally defined
# default limit.  When a value is not specified, there are no limits on the recursion.

# Select the multi pattern algorithm you want to run for scan/search the

# "ac-ks"   - Aho-Corasick, "Ken Steele" variant
# "hs"      - Hyperscan, available when built with Hyperscan support
#
# The default mpm-algo value of "auto" will use "hs" if Hyperscan is
# available, "ac" otherwise.
#
# The mpm you choose also decides the distribution of mpm contexts for
# signature groups, specified by the conf - "detect.sgh-mpm-context".
# Selecting "ac" as the mpm would require "detect.sgh-mpm-context"
# to be set to "single", because of ac's memory requirements, unless the
# ruleset is small enough to fit in memory, in which case one can
# use "full" with "ac".  The rest of the mpms can be run in "full" mode.

## Netfilter integration
##

# When running in NFQ inline mode, it is possible to use a simulated
# non-terminal NFQUEUE verdict.
# This permits sending all needed packet to Suricata via this rule:
#        iptables -I FORWARD -m mark ! --mark $MARK/$MASK -j NFQUEUE
# And below, you can have your standard filtering ruleset. To activate
# this mode, you need to set mode to 'repeat'
# If you want a packet to be sent to another queue after an ACCEPT decision
# set the mode to 'route' and set next-queue value.
# On Linux >= 3.1, you can set batchcount to a value > 1 to improve performance
# by processing several packets before sending a verdict (worker runmode only).
# On Linux >= 3.6, you can set the fail-open option to yes to have the kernel
# accept the packet if Suricata is not able to keep pace.
# bypass mark and mask can be used to implement NFQ bypass. If bypass mark is
# set then the NFQ bypass is activated. Suricata will set the bypass mark/mask
# on packet of a flow that need to be bypassed. The Nefilter ruleset has to
# directly accept all packets of a flow once a packet has been marked.
